  description = "Recently, Applied (AL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) have approached each other to the extent of being considered closely neighbouring subfields of linguistics. However, due to the complexity of interpreting CLâ€™s numeric indices and the lack understanding the methods it employs, only a small part of the vast number of these data-scientific methods is actually being exploited in AL by language researchers and L2 teachers, still, thus leaving a substantial gap between the two fields. <br/> Our research adopts a subset of machine learning (ML) algorithms adopted in CL and experimental methods of AL to enhance the quality of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research and L2 teaching, since the bilateral benefits of such closer cooperation are too large to ignore."

  description = "**Latent Aspects in L2 Acquisition (LAL2A)** is granted with a 3-year fund by the Hellenic Foundation for Reseach & Innovation (H.F.R.I.) within the 1st Call for H.F.R.I. Research Projects to Support Faculty Members & Researchers and Procure High-Value Research Equipment. The aim of H.F.R.I.'s call was two-fold: on the one hand to support the implementation of selected research projects of high scientific calibre and on the other hand to procure research equipment of high value and strategic importance, as part of the effort to support research activities in the country.<br/> Our proposal has been evaluated in two stages by 4 external reviewers and was ranked 7th with score 93/100 among the 96 proposals in the area of Humanities for category I."
