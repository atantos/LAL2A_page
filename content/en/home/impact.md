  description = "&rarr; Improvement of linguistic and communicative competence of speakers of Greek as a second language. Communication, in turn, influences social interaction since communicative and social abilities are tightly intertwined (Newman-Norlund et al., 2009). <br/> <br/>&rarr; Development of teacher’s self-confidence and teaching skills, as the whole process will expand their awareness of interlanguage concerns in L2. The implications for the curriculum design are obvious. <br/> <br/>&rarr; Adaptation to the foreign culture, in the form of acculturation, is best facilitated by the learner’s self-confidence regarding their achievements in the course of interlanguage. Congruence between students’ goals and achievements in the course of interlanguage influences adaptation in the foreign environment with reciprocal effects for the learner. (Jiang et al., 2009)."

  description = "&rarr; Computer-aided Error Analysis of such a depth will facilitate the emergence of distinct features that can identify certain stages of interlanguage even at the individual’s level. In fact, the researcher as well as the teacher will gain methodologically enriched insight in the path the language learning follows. This, in turn, can be seen as the feedback that the teacher receives with respect to the learning strategies they employ in the classroom. <br/><br/> &rarr; Combination of corpora and experimental methods should also ideally be integrated with linguistic theory. The fact that such an approach can be very rewarding is demonstrated by McKoon & MacFarland (2000: 856), who see as the most compelling aspect of their study the power gained by combining corpus analysis and psycholinguistic experimentation with linguistic theory, demonstrating how theoretical work and empirical work can inform each other. <br/><br/> &rarr; LAL2A is designed to offer provision of remedial influence. Specifically, in the case where the analysis of the individual’s production (written or spoken) may indicate a number of deviating patterns in L2, LAL2A will suggest a set of exercises that will make the learner aware of the target form. <br/><br/> &rarr; A number of advanced experimental techniques (i.e. eye-tracking to track sentence processing) will be used as a means of validating the patterns of interlanguage that emerge from the analysis of naturalistic data (corpora)."
