{{% aligned_text %}}

-   To explore the refugee & migrant children’s grammatical and vocabulary knowledge in their L2, through the use of standardized tests
-   To employ a series of educational techniques by means of implicit pedagogical tasks and processing instruction, as well as explicit language teaching, aiming at improving and accelerating bilingual children’s grammatical and lexical performance in the L2
-   To conduct pre- and post-tests, whose aim is to test the migrant children’s performance on a series of linguistic phenomena, such as vocabulary, determiners, agreement, tense and aspect, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational techniques in several time periods
-   To investigate which educational techniques are most appropriate for migrant children and which educational techniques work best for the linguistic phenomena under investigation

-   To explore whether factors such as (bi)literacy and cognitive abilities have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the educational techniques.
